## Overview

This course introduces the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems, with a specific emphasis on statistical and decision-theoretic modeling. Applications include diagnosis, game-playing, and robotics. The course is built around multi-part programming projects based on the game of Pacman.

Coursework consists of two kinds of assignments: programming projects (in Python) and weekly written homeworks.

### Prerequisites

This course has substantial elements of both programming and mathematics.

- **CS 3505** — Prior programming experience is expected; although Python is not required beforehand, you should be able to pick it up rapidly.
- **CS 3130** — Engineering Probability and Statistics
- **CS 4150** — Algorithms

### Expectations

You are expected to come to class prepared by reading the suggested sections of the book and the slides ahead of time.

### Textbooks

There is **no required textbook**. Recommended:

- *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (3rd ed.) — Stuart Russell & Peter Norvig (Prentice Hall, 2009). Be sure you have the **Third Edition (blue cover)**; other editions are not sufficient.
- *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* — Richard S. Sutton & Andrew G. Barto (MIT Press, 1998, First Edition). Available online.

Substantial parts of the course materials are taken from [CS 188 at Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/). Students are invited to look at their online lectures for alternative presentations of the materials.

### Grading

- Homework assignments (35%)
- Programming projects (35%)
- Exams 1–3 (30%)

Assignments (homework and projects) must be turned in electronically by **midnight** on the listed due date. Assignments may be turned in up to **two days late** with a **10% per-day** penalty.

There will be **two equally weighted in-class exams**, covering roughly the first and second halves of the class (totaling 30%). Exam 3 will take place during the final exam time slot.

There is a **one-week moratorium** on complaints about grading, etc.

### Course Policies

**Cheating.** Any assignment or exam that is handed in must be your own work. Talking with one another to understand the material better is encouraged, but copying others' solutions or letting others copy yours is cheating. Everything you hand in must be **in your own words** and based on **your own understanding**. High-level discussions to understand problems are fine. Any student caught cheating will be given an **E in the course** and referred to the University Student Behavior Committee.
